## TODO

 - [ ] Need to test the performance of the local llama3 model.
 - [ ] Need to test the advanced-RAG different methods.
 - [ ] Need to test llamaParser for better PDF parsing.
 - [ ] Need to test model conversion from huggingface to tensorRT format and test the performance locally. more info : https://engineering-technologists.com/2024/02/23/converting-huggingface-llm-to-tensorrt-for-use-in-the-triton-inference-server/
