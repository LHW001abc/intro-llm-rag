# What is Conversational AI?

Conversational AI means using technology with artificial intelligence to make machines talk to people. Basically, it figures out what someone says or writes and responds naturally to keep the conversation going. Thanks to recent improvements, machines can now have smart and natural conversations with humans.


# The Technology Behind Conversational AI

Conversational AI relies on various components to function, spanning from speech recognition to intent detection and concluding with a spoken or written response. The following components constitute the core of the conversational AI technology stack:

### 1. Speech-to-text:

- This technology converts spoken words into text transcriptions.

### 2. Language processing:
#### 2.1 Natural Language Understanding (NLU):

- NLU is the process by which technology comprehends natural human language.

- Especially crucial in voice interactions where speakers may not use specific keywords or share longer stories.


#### 2.2. Intent:

- Intents within conversational AI determine the actions triggered based on conversational inputs.

#### 2.3. Intent detection:

- This process involves the bot correctly identifying the intent behind an utterance.

- More challenging in voice compared to text due to the tendency for longer stories in speech.

#### 2.4. Value extraction:

- AI agents extract relevant information from customer queries and store them against corresponding 'slots.'

- Vital for handling multiple values in a single speech, ensuring natural conversations.

### 3. Text-To-Speech (TTS):

- This technology converts written text into spoken utterances.

- Off-the-shelf solutions may sound robotic, but voice actors can be used for natural responses.

### 4.Context and Multi-turn conversations:


- Conversational bots need to maintain context across multiple turns for natural-feeling conversations.

- Particularly important in voice interactions where chat history isn't displayed to the customer.
- Each back-and-forth interaction in a conversation is a 'turn.'

- Multi-turn conversations involve more than one interaction, contributing to a comprehensive dialogue.



### 5. Dialogue policy:

- Dialogue policy guides the flow of a conversation, allowing the bot to intelligently navigate a transaction.

- A robust dialogue policy accommodates interruptions, such as clarifying questions and enhancing the user experience.
