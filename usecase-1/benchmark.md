However, it can be inferred that it might be included under the   "Selective Call Rejection" feature as it allows creating a list of   up to 10 numbers from which incoming calls are automatically rejected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                             The   blacklist feature is a feature that allows users to block unwanted calls from   specific numbers. It is accessed by dialing *72 followed by the phone number   you want to block. This feature can be useful for individuals who receive   frequent unwanted calls from telemarketers, spammers, or other nuisance   callers. By blocking these numbers, users can reduce the amount of unwanted   calls they receive and improve their overall calling experience.                                                                                                                  |                                                      The   Blacklist feature is a call management tool that allows users to reject calls   from specific phone numbers. It can be accessed by dialing certain codes and   is not directly accessible through a button or soft key on the telephone set.                                                     |                                                                       According   to the provided context, the Blacklist feature is called "Selective Call   Rejection" (access code: *60). It allows you to create a list of up to   10 numbers from which incoming calls are automatically rejected. When the   parties on the list attempt to call, they will receive a recorded   announcement.                                                                      |                                                                         According   to the given context, the blacklist feature is called "Selective Call   Rejection" (access code *60).
